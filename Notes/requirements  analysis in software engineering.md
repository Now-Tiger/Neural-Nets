## Requirement Analysis in Software Engineering.

- __Requirement Analysis__ or __Requirement eng__. is the process used to determine the needs and expectations of a new product.
- It requires frequent communication with stakholders and end-users of the product to define expectations, resolve
  conflicts and document all the key requirements

- Requirement analysis is significant and essential activity after requirement gathering / elicitation.
- We analyze, refine and examine the gathered requirements to make consistent and unambigeous requirements.
- This activity reviews all requirements and may provide graphical view of entire system.
- Increases understandability of the project may improve significantly.

## Role of requirement analysis.
- Requirement analysis helps organizations to determine the actual needs of stakeholders.
- At the same time, it enables the development team to communicate with the stakeholders in a language they understand 
  (like charts, models, flow-diagrams) instead of pages of texts.
- It also allows software engineers to define the software allocation and build the model of the data, 
  functional and behavioural domains that will treat by software.

## What are the software requirements ?
- The software requirements are description of features and functionalities of the target system. 
- Requirements convey the expectations of users from software product.
- The requirements can be obvious or hidden, known or unknown, expected or unexpected from clients point of view.

### Various Steps of Requirement Analysis :
1. Draw the context diagram.
2. Develope prototypes.
3. Model the requirements.
4. Fanalise the requirements.
