1. Tensor :
    - n-dimensional array
    - A Tensor is a generalization of vectors and metrics and is easily understood as multidimensional array. 
    - A tensor represents a (possibly multi-dimensional) array of numerical values. With one axis, a tensor 
      corresponds (in math) to a vector. With two axes, a tensor corresponds to a matrix. Tensors with more 
      than two axes do not have special mathematical names.


* General maths - behind the scene :
    - In mathematical notation, we would denote such a unary scalar operator (taking one input) by the signature  f:R→R . 
    - This just means that the function is mapping from any real number ( R ) onto another. 
    - Likewise, we denote a binary scalar operator (taking two real inputs, and yielding one output) by the signature  f:R,R→R . 
    - Given any two vectors  u  and  v  of the same shape, and a binary operator  f , we can produce a vector  c=F(u,v)  
      by setting  ci←f(ui,vi)  for all  i , where  ci,ui , and  vi  are the  ith  elements of vectors  c,u , and  v . 
    - Here, we produced the vector-valued  F:Rd,Rd→Rd  by lifting the scalar function to an elementwise vector operation.


2. Linear Regression :
    - Regression refers to a set of methods for modeling the relationship between one or more independent variables and a 
      dependent variable. 
    - In the natural sciences and social sciences, the purpose of regression is most often to characterize the relationship 
      between the inputs and outputs. 
    - Machine learning, on the other hand, is most often concerned with prediction.

    - Regression problems pop up whenever we want to predict a numerical value. 
      Common examples include predicting prices (of homes, stocks, etc.), predicting length of stay (for patients in the hospital), 
      demand forecasting (for retail sales), among countless others.

    - the data corresponding to one sale(in house prices prediction case): is called an example (or data point, data instance, sample).
    
    - price = warea⋅area + wage⋅age + b.
    
    - warea  and wage are called weights, and b is called a bias (also called an offset or intercept)


3. Overfitting : 
    - Overfitting is referred to a model that models training data too well.

    - Overfitting occurs when you fit the model too closely to the particularities of training data set and obtain the model that 
      that works well on the training data but does not able generalization well on new/unseen data.
    
    - Meaning : The noise and random fluctuations in the training data set is picked up and learning as concept by the model.
                The problem's that these concepts does not apply to new/unseen data and negatively impacts the model's ability to 
                generalize.

    - Overfitting more likely to occur with nonparametric and nonlinear models that have more flexibility to learn target function.

    * Ex. :     Decision trees are nonparametric which are very flexible and are subject to overfitting the training data.
                This problem can be addressed by pruning the Decision tree after it has learned in order to remove some of the details 
                it has pickd up.
